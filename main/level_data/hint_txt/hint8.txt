Try to modify the 'ladder' array current ladder tiles, where there is a 1, to 0 first, so you don't use more than 3 ladder tiles. Think about where you want to put the ladder tiles, try and look at the visual feedback to understand where your ladders are wrongly placed.

Remember to use double array accessing:

ladder[0][0] = 1
ladder[0][1] = 0
